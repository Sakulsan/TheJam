&Hi there, pig, you seem lost.
|lost like many others here.
&You see, this world has been shrinking
for a long time now. 
|And many have fled of fear for it all to
crumble in on itself.
&I've seen many like you come and go,
none with regard to others.
|But you seem different, like you care for others.
&See dragons and penguins have lived
here since dawn of time, ever living in harmony.
|Now there arn't many of us that remain,
scavenging for what little is left.
&I will altough remain here until the end of time
|For it is all I've ever known
|But I wish for life to return
|Silence has plauged this land
&
