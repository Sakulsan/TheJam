As you look at the vast ocean you think of how 
far you have fallen. You used to be among the 
stars, now you are here, grounded, freezing 
and hungry. &You hear the waves crash against the shore 
and and your life flashes before your eyes. 
You remember waking up, talking to Sarox, 
walking outside and....|I guess those are all of my memories.&
Shells, artifacts, fishes and pinguins. All 
this life yet no trace of society. |No chance of being saved. All responsibility 
solely on my shoulders. |No shoulder to cry on. 
No extra hands. &The ocean. A symbol of my 
loneliness. A testament to my isolation. 
Ever cold. Ever dangerous.&Ocean: the final frontier.&Hope. A dangerous damaging feeling.|Everytime there is a glimmer att sea. hope 
arrises once more. It poisons the mind and 
weakens the determination.&Can you please stop talking to the ocean 
you stupid asenine moron? Why are you even 
talking to an inanimate objekt you nimwit. 
STOP IT!!!!!
